# Wordle
Hive Helsinki's Rush>Wordle project

`make` to compile the program

As there is no integration with the actual game itself, you must manually type the words into the game and the program.

Usage:
  1. Input the word into the game and the program
  2. Type the colors that are returned from the game into the program ('g' for green, 'y' for yellow, 's' for silver/grey)

The game could be found at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
